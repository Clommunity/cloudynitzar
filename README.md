# cloudynitzar

### About
Cloudynitzar is a shell script that turns your plain Debian system into a community networking cloud in a box (i.e. a full-featured Cloudy device). It might work on Debian derivatives too, like Ubuntu. Feel free to test and report!

### Requirements
An updated Debian installation (at least Wheezy 7.8) with `curl`, `lsb-release` and Internet connection.

### Procedure
From your Debian system run, as root:

`curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clommunity/cloudynitzar/master/cloudynitzar.sh | bash -`

and let the magic begin!
