# cloudynitzar
Cloudynitzar is a shell script that turns your plain Debian system into a community networking cloud in a box (i.e. a full-featured Cloudy device).

From your Debian system run, as root:

curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clommunity/cloudynitzar/master/cloudynitzar.sh | bash -

and let the magic begin!
